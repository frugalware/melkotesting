Evenbalance, developer of Punkbuster dropped support for Wolfenstein Enemy Territory (ET).
Also the Punkbusterinstaller isn`t able to install the neccessary files
for Enemy Territory. So if you got disconnected from servers and getting some #20004 errors,
 you can run 'et-pbupdate' instead of 'pbweb'.
