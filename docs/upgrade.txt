= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.7 to 1.8

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.7
(Gaia) system to Frugalware-1.8 (Cinna).

== Deprecated package removal

Some packages will not gracefully be removed because of strict dependencies.
Here is the command to remove them before an upgrade:

----
pacman-g2 -Rd systemd-gtk systemd-plymouth dracut-plymouth plymouth plymouth-theme-frugalware plymouth-theme-glow plymouth-theme-solar plymouth-theme-spinfinity ffmpeg-compiletime ffmpeg-0.6 ffmpeg-0.6-compiletime
----

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved `pacman-g2`, you should install it
first:

----
pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== GRUB2 upgrade

GRUB2 has been upgraded to its latest release. Please check your grub config
under `/etc/default/grub` and compare it to the `/etc/default/grub.pacnew`
file and update it as needed. The main things to look for is changing the
`GRUB_BACKGROUND` to `/boot/grub/background.png` and removing `splash` from
`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`, as `plymouth` has been removed. Also, please
feel free to look at what is new in the default config. You may find something
you wish to try out.

Now that your config has been updated, it's time to upgrade GRUB2 in your MBR.
Running `grubconfig` as root should be enough to complete this task for you,
provided `grubconfig` worked for you when you originally installed or upgraded
to 1.7. If it is not, please try these commands, making sure to replace DEVICE
wit the device node of the hard drive your root partition is on:

----
grub-install --no-floppy --recheck --boot-directory=/boot DEVICE
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
----

== vconsole.conf

`/etc/sysconfig/keymap` and `/etc/sysconfig/font` is now replaced by
systemd's `/etc/vconsole.conf`. If you still have those files around
after the upgrade, please manually merge their contents to
`vconsole.conf`, and then remove those files.

----
rm -f /etc/sysconfig/{font,keymap}
----

== locale.conf
`/etc/sysconfig/language` and `/etc/profile.d/lang.sh` is now replaced
by systemd's `/etc/locale.conf`.  These should be automatically converted
to `/etc/locale.conf` upon upgrade, but if not then you should manually
merge the `LANG` variable from `/etc/profile.d/lang.sh` to `/etc/locale.conf`.

Also, if the new `/etc/locale.conf` file does not have `.utf8` at the end
of your `LANG` variable, then you should manually append it. We will no
longer be supporting any other locale character encoding after this stable
release.

This change is badly needed for many terminal applications and terminal
emulators to function in unicode.

Finally, when you are done with the conversion, you should remove the file.

----
rm -f /etc/profile.d/lang.sh
----

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
