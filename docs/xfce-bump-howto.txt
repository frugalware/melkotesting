= XFCE Bump HOWTO

You *MUST* follow this HOWTO when bumping XFCE to a new version (even a minor
version).

To start, packages must be compiled in the order listed below (if you find a
change that needs to be made to this list, poke Priyank). If it is a major 
bump (i.e. 4.4 to 4.6) it is wise to check the updated build order on the Xfce website.

== XFCE compile order

- xfce4-dev-tools
- libxfce4util
- xfconf
- libxfcegui4
- libxfce4ui
- libxfce4menu
- libexo
- garcon
- xfce4-panel
- thunar
- xfdesktop
- xfce4-settings
- xfce4-session
- xfwm4
- xfce4-mixer
- xfprint
- xfce4-appfinder
- xfwm4-themes
- thunar-volman
- gtk-xfce-engine
- orage
- xfce4-power-manager
- tumbler

The following packages can be built in any order, but *ONLY* after the above
packages have been built

- xfce-frugalware
- thunar-archive-plugin
- thunar-media-tags-plugin
- xfce4-icon-theme
- terminal
- mousepad
- the rest of the plugins
